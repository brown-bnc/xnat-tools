# Welcome to xnat-tools

XNAT tools is maintained by members of the [Behavioral Neuroimaging Core](https://brown-bnc.github.io) at Brown University. This package facilitates the export and conversion of data stored in Brown's XNAT platform, to the BIDS format. The optimal way to install and run this package depends on your computation environment. We outline all the possibilities.

We maintain documentation for all of our stable releases as well as our development code. Please select the version of the documentation/package to get started.
